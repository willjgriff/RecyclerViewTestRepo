# android-playground
Playground for learning android components. This project is for personal development, to understand the Android framework's capabilities, and doesn't serve any useful purpose. I have attempted to adhere to the Material Design guidelines. However, note none of the screens have much design thought put into them, they just allow me to understand components that could be used to make good design.

I have attempted to create a base MVP Architecture which is a work in progress. There are 3 examples of this:
</br>MyFirstAttempt - My initial attempt at creating a basic structure.
</br>Remind101ExampleAdapted - An adaptation of an example from http://engineering.remind.com/android-code-that-scales/ which integrates MVP in list structures and considers ViewHolders to be Views. See <b>Movies</b> for basic usage.
</br>RxMvp - Finally I've started creating one using Rx which I'll continue building as I understand Rx. See <b>Ethereum</b> for basic usage.

I've played with RxAndroid, Retrofit and Picasso here at a basic level. I'm interested in using Dagger which I'm yet to get round to.

Once I have enough UI ideas I'll create a basic Ethereum blockchain explorer.
